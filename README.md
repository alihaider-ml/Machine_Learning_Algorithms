## 📁 Included Algorithms

### 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Synthetic classification dataset generated using `make_classification`
- Model built using `KNeighborsClassifier`
- Accuracy evaluation and decision boundary visualization

### 🔹 Linear Regression
- Synthetic regression dataset used
- Model built using `LinearRegression`
- Performance evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score
- Visualization of regression line and data distribution

> More algorithms will be added soon, including Logistic Regression,  Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Clustering methods.
