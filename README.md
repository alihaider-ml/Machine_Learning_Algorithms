# K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier on Synthetic Data

This project demonstrates a basic application of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm using Python and scikit-learn. It involves generating synthetic classification data, training a k-NN model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the decision boundary.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Synthetic data generation using `make_classification`
- Data splitting into training and testing sets
- Model training using `KNeighborsClassifier`
- Accuracy evaluation
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
