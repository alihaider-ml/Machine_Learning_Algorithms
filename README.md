# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains clean and concise implementations of essential machine learning algorithms using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn. The goal is to build a reference collection of ML models with clear code, helpful visualizations, and basic evaluations — ideal for learners and developers.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `knn/`  
  K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier using synthetic data.
  
  Features:
  - Synthetic data generation using `make_classification`
  - Model training using `KNeighborsClassifier`
  - Accuracy evaluation
  - Decision boundary visualization



*More algorithms will be added soon, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.*

## 🚀 Getting Started
